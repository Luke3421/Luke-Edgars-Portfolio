            <p><left> Growing up, I've always had a love for technology and computers.
            I never truly understood the gravity of coding until my last year of
            highschool, but I never new what being a computer science major meant. Once starting my journey
            of Computer Science, I have enjoyed every aspect and continue to hone my skills in programming and development.
            This webpage is something I have programmed to challenge myself. . .</left></p>

            It was our final project for high performance computing. We where able to grab some TIF files that outline a large group of counties in the state of Iowa. With also having the shape file of all county outlines in our country,
            we could cut out the counties we wanted by matching the coordinates and iterate through use a geopandas to grab the pixel values.
            With the pixel values we could see what was most prominent in each county and see how the values grew over the 12 year period. This is all shown with a dynamic graph.</td>
